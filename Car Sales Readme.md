**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Car Sales Data**

**Project Overview**

This project involves conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python in a Jupyter Notebook to explore and analyze car sales data. The goal is to uncover key insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and market dynamics within the automotive industry. The analysis aims to support data-driven decision-making for stakeholders, including manufacturers, dealerships, and marketers.

**Objective**

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Sales Trend Analysis:** Identify and analyze trends in car sales over time across different models, regions, and periods.
1. **Customer Insights:** Explore customer demographics, preferences, and purchasing behaviour to understand the factors influencing car sales.
1. **Market Segmentation:** Segment the market based on car types, price ranges, and customer profiles to identify key segments and growth opportunities.
1. **Revenue Analysis:** Assess revenue distribution by car model, region, and dealership to identify top-performing segments.
1. **Sales Forecasting:** Utilize historical data to make preliminary predictions about future car sales trends.

**Data Source**

The dataset used for this analysis contains detailed records of car sales transactions, including information on:
